"""Historical fundamentals must not leak a live company profile (#1300).

Vendor "company overview" endpoints (yfinance ``Ticker.info``, Alpha Vantage
``OVERVIEW``) serve only present-day values: market cap, valuation multiples,
the 52-week range and TTM income all move with today's quote, and even name,
sector and industry shift when a company renames or is reclassified. None of it
carries a historical vintage, so emitting it into a run dated in the past puts
post-decision information into the analyst's context, in the same family as the
FRED (#1275), social (#1220) and memory (#1251) leaks.

Both vendors withhold on one shared rule (``date_window.withhold_live_profile``)
so switching ``fundamental_data`` between them cannot reintroduce the leak. The
statement tools stay point-in-time by filtering on ``curr_date``, and a live run
is unchanged. All API access is mocked.
